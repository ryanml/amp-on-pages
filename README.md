##  âš¡âš¡ Amp on Pages ðŸ“„ðŸ“„ 

This plugin aims to be a fast remedy for the lack of AMP support for Wordpress pages (the 'page' post type)

This requires the [AMP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/) plugin of course, and is compatible with the Yoast SEO plugin and its AMP glue add-on. 

Pull requests with improvements will be gladly reviewed and merged :)
